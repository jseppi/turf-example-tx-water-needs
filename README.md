This page shows potential water shortages for each county in Texas for each of the 6 planning decades of the 2012 Texas Water Plan.

This is a demonstration/exercise using [TurfJS](http://turfjs.org/) and [Mapbox JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js) with data available from the 2012 Texas State Water Plan API at http://texasstatewaterplan.org/api/v1. 

**This was made as a purely experimental exercise and probably hides or misinterprets some of the data. Don't use for anything official.**

For more information on water planning in Texas, see the official water plan at http://www.twdb.texas.gov/waterplanning/swp/2012/index.asp
